## 📌 What’s Inside? 🚀

### 📈 Counting and Plotting
A comparative study between two queue implementations:
- 📝 **Ordered List Queue**
- 🛠️ **Binary Heap Priority Queue**

🔍 This project measures and plots the number of comparisons performed during **insertion** and **removal** operations. The results are displayed using high-resolution plots 📊 to highlight performance differences.

---

### 🗜️ Huffman Coding
An implementation of the classic **Huffman coding algorithm** for **lossless data compression** 📦.  
Features:
- 📐 Huffman Tree construction  
- 📝 Prefix code generation  
- 📄 Efficient file compression and decompression  

Ideal for understanding how to reduce data size without losing information.

---

### 🧠 SAT Solver
A simple yet illustrative **Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) solver** implemented in **C**.  
It checks whether a propositional logic formula in **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)** is satisfiable ✔️❌.  
Useful for exploring:
- 📊 Combinatorial problem-solving  
- 📏 Backtracking algorithms and logic decision procedures

---

### 🗺️ A* Algorithm (Seminar)
A theoretical and practical study of the **A\*** search algorithm 🔍🚀.  
One of the most renowned pathfinding algorithms in AI and graph theory.  
Covers:
- 🎯 Heuristic functions  
- 📝 Optimal path search in weighted graphs  
- 📊 Complexity and performance analysis  

Developed as part of an academic seminar on search algorithms 📖.
